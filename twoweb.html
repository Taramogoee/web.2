            <h1>About accessory</h1>
            <p>One of the most attractive and important accessories for women is a bag. Maybe in the past, the main purpose of using this device was simply for the purpose of transporting things. But over time, this attractive accessory found a special place not only as a means of transportation but also because of its impact on style. Paying attention to the type of clothing and the harmony between them has been popular among women since the past. There were few people among the women who were so unimportant. But there are few who have a correct understanding of the role and importance of a bag in style.</p>
